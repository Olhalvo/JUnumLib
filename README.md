# JUnumLIB
###### Because unsigneds in Java SUCK

_____________________________________

### so what is this?

Amidst my struggles with emudev in Java, I realised that this language that I deeply ***"love"*** is absolutely torturous
when it comes to handling unsigned numbers. Thus, I decided to bring it into my own grubby hands to solve the issue, because
realistically how does a language with such recognition and that, and I quote Mr. Oracle himself "Runs in 3 billion devices"
not have native support for unsigned numbers?
-------------------------------------
### what does it do?

Well If I haven't been clear enough, it solves one of the most infuriating issues(at least for me) in Java,
which is the lack of unsigned numbers. It does this by providing a set of classes that mimic the behaviour of
unsigned integers, With options for either strict limits or with overflow behaviour. also providing a set of utilities
to make the usage and conversion to and from native types easier.
-------------------------------------
### how do I use it?
Well, for now it's not yet published or finished, I plan on publish it to Maven Central once it's done, but for now
you can clone the repo and build it yourself. Once you have the jar, you can add it to your project and start using it.
For help with usage, you can check the javadocs or the wiki, which I will be updating with examples and guides.
